# E-Moto-Energy-Simulator
This Python code calculates the estimated power and energy requirements of an electric motorcycle based on GPS data input. It uses the GPS data to compute the power and energy needs of a motorcycle for a specific trip, optimizing energy management and performance analysis. The code includes functions to plot total energy profiles, smoothed power profiles, and total energy consumed over time and distance.

# Features
- Converts GPS data into energy consumption estimates for electric motorcycles.
- Accounts for factors such as vehicle mass, air density, drag coefficients, and efficiency.
- Generates visualizations of power profiles and energy consumption over time and distance.
